# This workflow will send a trace of each build step to Honeycomb.

# A free Honeycomb account—this includes 20 million events per month, which is ample event
# volume to support very large and complex production build pipelines. It should
# accommodate almost all buildevents use cases with ease.

# To get started:
# 1. Visit the Honeycomb Sign Up Page and create an account.
# 2. Name your team (any name—like your company name, for example—will do).
# 3. Copy your API key.
#     * If you’re a new user, you’ll see your API key on the screen that’s displayed as Honeycomb waits to receive your data.
#     * If you’re an existing user, you can find your API key by clicking on "Environments" and selecting "Manage Environments". 
# 4. Create a GitHub Action Secret with this API key named "BUILDEVENT_APIKEY"


# This workflow will build a Java project with Maven
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/building-and-testing-java-with-maven

          By default buildevents will add a number of additional fields from the environment, such as
          the branch name, the repository, the build number, and so on.

          In addition, you can add custom fields by using the globally set BUILDEVENT_FILE. This variable is
          used as the path of a text file holding arbitrary key=val pairs (multi-line-capable, logfmt style)
          that will be added to all remaining Honeycomb events.

          The final parameter of the command is NAME. This is used to label the span when viewing a trace.
          When the ID is human readable, it is easy to reuse this ID as the name. In the event of autogenerated
          IDs, make sure to set a useful NAME as the final parameter of the step command.

          Not all commands within a run step need to wrapped with the buildevents cmd call.

          The cmd mode invokes an individual command that is part of a step, such as running DB migrations
          or running a specific test suite. It must be able to be expressed as a single shell command - either
          a process like go test or a shell script. The command to run is the final argument to buildevents and
          will be launched via bash -c using exec. You can specify an alternate shell using the -s/--shell flag
          but it must support the the -c flag.

          These environment variables will be used by the finish step, and therefore must be exported.

          While custom run steps can be instrumented directly as shown in the previous steps, you can
          use this technique of a wrapping 'start' and 'finish' step to capture 3rd party actions in
          spans, or to capture a group of steps as a single span.
